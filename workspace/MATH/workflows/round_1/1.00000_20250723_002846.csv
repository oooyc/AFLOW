**Problem Statement:**
*A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?*

### Understanding the Problem
First, I need to understand the scenario:
1. **Shape**: It's a convex pentagon, meaning it has five sides and all its interior angles are less than 180°.
2. **Angles**: 
   - Two of the angles are congruent (equal in measure) and acute (less than 90°).
   - The other three angles are larger, and each of these larger angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

### Drawing a Diagram
Visualizing helps. I'll sketch a pentagon ABCDE:
- Let's say angles A and B are the two congruent, acute angles.
- Angles C, D, and E are the larger angles, each equal to A + B.

### Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon
I recall that the sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) × 180°.

For a pentagon (n=5):
Sum of interior angles = (5-2) × 180° = 3 × 180° = 540°.

### Setting Up the Equation
Given:
- Angle A = Angle B = x (since they are congruent and acute).
- Angles C, D, E = A + B = x + x = 2x.

Now, the sum of all angles is:
A + B + C + D + E = x + x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 8x.

But we know the sum must be 540°:
8x = 540°.

### Solving for x
Let's solve for x:
x = 540° / 8 = 67.5°.

But wait, angle A and B are acute angles, meaning they must be less than 90°.

67.5° is indeed less than 90°, so this fits the condition.

### Finding the Large Angles
The problem asks for the common measure of the large angles, which are angles C, D, and E.

From earlier, each large angle is 2x:
2x = 2 × 67.5° = 135°.

### Verification
Let's verify the sum:
- Two angles at 67.5° each: 2 × 67.5° = 135°.
- Three angles at 135° each: 3 × 135° = 405°.
- Total sum: 135° + 405° = 540°.

This matches the required sum for a pentagon. 

### Conclusion
The common measure of the large angles is 135°.

\boxed{135}","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.020835999999999997

[/asy]","Alright, I have this problem about a magic square, and I need to find the value of \( n \). First, I need to understand what a magic square is. From what I know, a magic square is a grid (in this case, 4x4) where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Understanding the Magic Square Layout
Looking at the Asymptote code provided, it's a 4x4 grid, but the labels are only in the first three rows and columns. That's a bit confusing because a 4x4 magic square would have 4 rows and 4 columns. But looking at the code:
```asy
for(int i = 0; i<4; ++i) { draw((0,i)--(3,i),linewidth(1)); }
for(int j = 0; j<4; ++j) { draw((j,0)--(j,3),linewidth(1)); }
```
It's drawing lines from (0,i) to (3,i) and (j,0) to (j,3). That means it's a 4x4 grid, but the labels are only in the first three rows and columns. However, the magic square is actually 3x3 because the last row and column are not labeled.

Looking at the labels:
- First row: (0.5,0.5) is \( n-3 \), (1.5,0.5) is \( n+2 \), (2.5,0.5) is 2.
- Second row: (0.5,1.5) is 3, (1.5,1.5) is \( 2n-9 \), (2.5,1.5) is \( n \).
- Third row: (0.5,2.5) is \( n+1 \), (1.5,2.5) is 1, (2.5,2.5) is \( n-1 \).

### Drawing the Magic Square
Based on the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 grid. Let's represent it as a matrix:

| \( n-3 \) | \( n+2 \) | 2 |
|-----------|-----------|---|
| 3         | \( 2n-9 \) | \( n \) |
| \( n+1 \) | 1         | \( n-1 \) |

### Understanding Magic Square Properties
For a 3x3 magic square, all rows, columns, and both main diagonals must have the same sum.

### Step 1: Find the Magic Sum
First, I need to find the common sum. To find it, I can use the fact that the sum of all elements in the magic square is equal to 3 times the magic sum (since there are 3 rows).

But first, let's write down all the elements:
1. \( n-3 \)
2. \( n+2 \)
3. 2
4. 3
5. \( 2n-9 \)
6. \( n \)
7. \( n+1 \)
8. 1
9. \( n-1 \)

Now, sum them up:
\[ (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 + 3 + (2n-9) + n + (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) \]

Let's simplify:
- Combine like terms:
  \[ n + n + 2n + n + n = 6n \]
  \[ -3 + 2 + 2 + 3 -9 + 1 + 1 -1 = ( -3 + 2 ) = -1 \]
  \[ -1 + 2 = 1 \]
  \[ 1 + 3 = 4 \]
  \[ 4 -9 = -5 \]
  \[ -5 + 1 = -4 \]
  \[ -4 + 1 = -3 \]
  \[ -3 -1 = -4 \]

Total sum: \( 6n - 4 \)

Since the magic sum \( S \) is the sum of any row, the total sum of all elements is \( 3S \). So:
\[ 3S = 6n - 4 \]
\[ S = 2n - \frac{4}{3} \]

But \( S \) must be an integer because all the elements are integers. However, \( \frac{4}{3} \) is not an integer. This suggests a problem.

### Verification
Looking back at the simplification:
\[ (n-3) + (n+2) = 2n -1 \]
\[ 2n -1 + 2 = 2n +1 \]
\[ 2n +1 +3 = 2n +4 \]
\[ 2n +4 + (2n-9) = 4n -5 \]
\[ 4n -5 + n = 5n -5 \]
\[ 5n -5 + (n+1) = 6n -4 \]
\[ 6n -4 +1 = 6n -3 \]
\[ 6n -3 + (n-1) = 7n -4 \]

Oops! I made a mistake. I only considered up to \( n \) terms but missed the last term \( n-1 \). The correct total sum is \( 7n -4 \).

Now, recalculate \( S \):
\[ 3S = 7n -4 \]
\[ S = \frac{7n -4}{3} \]

Still, \( S \) must be an integer. So \( 7n -4 \) must be divisible by 3.

### Find n such that \( 7n -4 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)
Let's solve \( 7n -4 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)
\[ 7n \equiv 4 \mod 3 \]
But \( 7 \mod 3 \) is \( 1 \) because \( 7 = 2*3 +1 \)
So:
\[ n \equiv 4 \mod 3 \]
\[ n \equiv 1 \mod 3 \]

This means \( n \) can be 1, 4, 7, 10, etc.

But we need more information to find the exact value of \( n \).

### Using a Row or Column to Find n
Let's take the first row:
\[ (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = S \]
\[ 2n -3 +2 +2 = S \]
\[ 2n +1 = S \]

But from earlier, \( S = \frac{7n -4}{3} \). So:
\[ 2n +1 = \frac{7n -4}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 6n +3 = 7n -4 \]
Bring all terms to one side:
\[ 6n -7n +3 +4 = 0 \]
\[ -n +7 = 0 \]
\[ n =7 \]

Now, check if \( n=7 \) satisfies the earlier condition \( n \equiv 1 \mod 3 \):
\[ 7 \mod 3 = 1 \]
Yes, it does.

### Verification
Let's verify \( n=7 \) in the magic square.

Substitute \( n=7 \) into the square:
- First row: \( 7-3=4 \), \( 7+2=9 \), \( 2 \)
- Second row: \( 3 \), \( 2*7-9=5 \), \( 7 \)
- Third row: \( 7+1=8 \), \( 1 \), \( 7-1=6 \)

Now, the magic square looks like:
| 4 | 9 | 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 5 | 7 |
| 8 | 1 | 6 |

### Check Rows
1. First row: \( 4 +9 +2 = 15 \)
2. Second row: \( 3 +5 +7 = 15 \)
3. Third row: \( 8 +1 +6 = 15 \)

### Check Columns
1. First column: \( 4 +3 +8 = 15 \)
2. Second column: \( 9 +5 +1 = 15 \)
3. Third column: \( 2 +7 +6 = 15 \)

### Check Diagonals
1. Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): \( 4 +5 +6 = 15 \)
2. Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): \( 2 +5 +8 = 15 \)

All sums are equal to 15, so \( n=7 \) is indeed the correct value.

### Conclusion
The value of \( n \) that makes the given square a magic square is \(\boxed{7}\).","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.
