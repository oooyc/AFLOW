**Problem Statement:**
*A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?*

### Understanding the Problem
First, I need to understand the scenario:
1. **Shape**: It's a convex pentagon, meaning it has five sides and all its interior angles are less than 180°.
2. **Angles**: 
   - Two of the angles are congruent (equal in measure) and acute (less than 90°).
   - The other three angles are larger, and each of these larger angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

### Drawing a Diagram
Visualizing helps. I draw a pentagon ABCDE:
- Let's say angles A and B are the two congruent, acute angles.
- Angles C, D, and E are the larger angles, each equal to angle A + angle B.

### Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon
I recall that the sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) × 180°.
For a pentagon (n=5), the sum is (5-2) × 180° = 540°.

### Setting Up Variables
Let's denote:
- The measure of angle A = angle B = x degrees (since they are congruent and acute).
- The other three angles (C, D, E) are each equal to the sum of angles A and B, so angle C = angle D = angle E = x + x = 2x.

### Writing the Equation
Now, the sum of all interior angles is:
angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D + angle E = 540°.

Substituting the values:
x + x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 540°.

Combine like terms:
(1x + 1x + 2x + 2x + 2x) = 8x = 540°.

### Solving for x
Now, divide both sides by 8 to find x:
8x = 540° → x = 540° / 8 → x = 67.5°.

### Finding the Large Angles
The problem asks for the common measure of the large angles, which are angles C, D, and E, each equal to 2x.

So, 2x = 2 × 67.5° = 135°.

### Verification
Let's verify the solution:
- Angles A and B are both 67.5° (acute and congruent).
- Angles C, D, and E are each 135°.
- Sum: 67.5° + 67.5° + 135° + 135° + 135° = 540°.

This matches the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon. Also, since the pentagon is convex, all angles must be less than 180°:
- 67.5° < 180° (valid, and acute).
- 135° < 180° (valid).

### Conclusion
The common measure of the large angles is 135°.

\boxed{135}","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.015796

[/asy]","Alright, I have this problem about a magic square, and I need to find the value of \( n \). A magic square is a grid where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal. 

First, let's understand the given information. The magic square is a 3x3 grid, and the Asymptote code provides the positions of the numbers. Here's how the square looks based on the labels:

- First row: \( n-3 \), \( n+2 \), \( 2 \)
- Second row: \( 3 \), \( 2n - 9 \), \( n \)
- Third row: \( n+1 \), \( 1 \), \( n-1 \)

So, the magic square is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n - 9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

In a magic square, all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals sum to the same number, called the magic constant. Let's denote the magic constant by \( S \).

**Step 1: Calculate the magic constant \( S \) using one of the rows or columns.**

Looking at the third row, it seems simple:
\[ (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1 \]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

**Step 2: Verify with another row or column to ensure consistency.**

Let's check the first row:
\[ (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1 \]
This also equals \( S \), which is good.

Check the second row:
\[ 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6 \]
This must equal \( S = 2n + 1 \), so:
\[ 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \]
\[ 3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

Okay, so \( n = 7 \). But before concluding, let's verify with columns to ensure everything checks out.

**Step 3: Verify with columns.**

First column:
\[ (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 \]
Which matches \( S \).

Second column:
\[ (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 \]
We have \( S = 2n + 1 \), so:
\[ 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \]
\[ n = 7 \]
Consistent again.

Third column:
\[ 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1 \]
Matches \( S \).

**Step 4: Verify the diagonals.**

Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[ (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = 4n - 13 \]
Set equal to \( S \):
\[ 4n - 13 = 2n + 1 \]
\[ 2n = 14 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
\[ 2 + (2n - 9) + (n + 1) = 2 + 2n - 9 + n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]
We know \( S = 2n + 1 \), so:
\[ 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

Everything checks out with \( n = 7 \).

**Step 5: Final verification.**

Let's plug \( n = 7 \) back into the square to ensure all sums are equal.

The square becomes:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
7 - 3 = 4 & 7 + 2 = 9 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2*7 - 9 = 5 & 7 \\
\hline
7 + 1 = 8 & 1 & 7 - 1 = 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, calculate the sums:

Rows:
1. \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
2. \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
3. \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

Columns:
1. \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
2. \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
3. \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

Diagonals:
1. \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
2. \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

All sums are indeed equal to 15, confirming that \( n = 7 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.
