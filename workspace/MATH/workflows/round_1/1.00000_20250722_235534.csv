**Problem Statement:**
*A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?*

### Understanding the Problem
First, I need to understand the scenario:
1. **Shape**: It's a convex pentagon, meaning it has five sides and all its interior angles are less than 180°.
2. **Angles**: 
   - Two of the angles are congruent (equal in measure) and acute (less than 90°).
   - The other three angles are larger, and each of these larger angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

### Drawing a Diagram
Visualizing helps. I'll sketch a pentagon ABCDE:
- Let's say angles A and B are the two congruent acute angles.
- Angles C, D, and E are the larger angles, each equal to A + B.

### Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon
I recall that the sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) × 180°.
For a pentagon (n=5), the sum is (5-2) × 180° = 540°.

### Setting Up the Equation
Given:
- Angle A = Angle B = x (since they're congruent and acute).
- Angles C, D, E = A + B = x + x = 2x.

Now, the sum of all interior angles is:
A + B + C + D + E = x + x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 8x.

But we know the sum must be 540°:
8x = 540°.

### Solving for x
Let's solve for x:
x = 540° / 8 = 67.5°.

### Checking the Conditions
The problem states that the two angles are acute, i.e., less than 90°.
x = 67.5° < 90° → satisfies the condition.

The other angles are 2x = 135°.
Since the pentagon is convex, all angles must be less than 180°.
135° < 180° → satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion
The common measure of the large angles (C, D, E) is 2x = 135°.

### Verification
Just to be sure, let's add them up:
2 (67.5°) + 3 (135°) = 135° + 405° = 540°.
Which matches the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon.

### Final Answer
The common measure of the large angles is \(\boxed{135}\) degrees.","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.004742

[/asy]","Alright, I have this problem about a magic square, and I need to find the value of \( n \). First, I need to understand what a magic square is. From what I know, a magic square is a grid (in this case, 3x3) where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Understanding the Magic Square Layout
Looking at the Asymptote code provided, it's a 3x3 grid. The labels are placed as follows:

- **First Column**:
  - (0.5, 0.5) → Row 1, Column 1 → \( n-3 \)
  - (0.5, 1.5) → Row 2, Column 1 → 3
  - (0.5, 2.5) → Row 3, Column 1 → \( n+1 \)

- **Second Column**:
  - (1.5, 0.5) → Row 1, Column 2 → \( n+2 \)
  - (1.5, 1.5) → Row 2, Column 2 → \( 2n-9 \)
  - (1.5, 2.5) → Row 3, Column 2 → 1

- **Third Column**:
  - (2.5, 0.5) → Row 1, Column 3 → 2
  - (2.5, 1.5) → Row 2, Column 3 → \( n \)
  - (2.5, 2.5) → Row 3, Column 3 → \( n-1 \)

### Step 1: Find the Magic Sum
First, I need to find the common sum (magic sum) for all rows, columns, and diagonals. To find this, I can start by using the first row.

**First Row Sum**:
\[ (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1 \]

Now, I can use the third column to verify or find another expression.

**Third Column Sum**:
\[ 2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1 \]

Great, both the first row and the third column give the same sum \( 2n + 1 \). This consistency is a good sign.

### Step 2: Use the Second Row to Find \( n \)
Now, let's write the sum for the second row.

**Second Row Sum**:
\[ 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6 \]

But since the magic sum is \( 2n + 1 \), we can set them equal:
\[ 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \]

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ 3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

### Verification
Now that I have \( n = 7 \), I should verify it by checking other rows, columns, and diagonals.

**First Column Sum**:
\[ (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = (7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \]

**Magic Sum**:
\[ 2n + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15 \]

**Second Column Sum**:
\[ (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = (7+2) + (14-9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \]

**Third Row Sum**:
\[ (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \]

**Main Diagonal (Top-left to Bottom-right)**:
\[ (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (14-9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \]

**Other Diagonal (Top-right to Bottom-left)**:
\[ 2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 2 + (14-9) + (7+1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \]

All sums match the magic sum of 15. This confirms that \( n = 7 \) is indeed the correct value.

### Conclusion
After setting up the equations based on the magic square property and verifying them, the value of \( n \) that satisfies all conditions is:

\boxed{7}","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.
